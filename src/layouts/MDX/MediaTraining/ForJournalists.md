            > founder Mark Albert has a quarter-century of experience as an
            investigative journalist and educator. He’s been an adjunct
            instructor at Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism
            in Washington, DC, and nearly every year since 2017, has created and
            taught curriculum in newsrooms across Vietnam, including on
            fact-checking, news production, investigative reporting, how to ask
            probing questions in news conferences and hold public officials
            accountable, digital content creation, elements of live-streaming,
            and on Western free speech and defamation principles. In 2016, he
            designed and taught a two-week course on general news production in
            Pakistan as part of an initiative administered by the International
            Center for Journalists (ICFL) and sponsored by the U.S. State
            Department. Mark has also spoken on panels at the preeminent
            investigative journalism conference in the United States, the
            Investigative Reporters & Editors (IRE) event every June, invited to
            speak on topics such as internal/external newsroom collaboration and
            military beat reporting.
